 Exchange Types in RabbitMq

1 - Fanout Exchange
2 - Direct Exchange
3 - Topic Exchange
4 - Header Exchange

All have different routing 

Exchange : Routes the messages to queues, which are published by the producer(publisher)
Default Exchange  :  Sending messages which are published by the publisher, directly to queues without using exchange

Consumers(subscribers) don't know echange, they connect to queues to read messages

1 - We can have producer to create both the exchange and the queues in some scenarios
or 
2 - we can have producer to create the exchange and consumer to create the queues.


for 1 - since queues are created by the producer, even if the consumers are not up, the messages will reside in exchange and queue, and will remain not deleted
for 2 - if the consumers are not up, the messages will come to exchange and since no queue are created yet, the message will get deleted from not delivering to the queue


1 - Fanout Exchange
--------------------
When producer publishes a message, Fanout exchange sends all messages to all queues bound to itself,  without applying any filter.
If there is a message msg1, fe sends this same msg1 to all queues that bound to itself 1 by 1 for eg.
In this scenario, producer creates the exchange and sends message.  It is consumers job to create queue/s to listen or not.
If no consumer so no queue, no messages willget received, because producer doesn't care here if the message is recewived or not.


2 - Direct Exchange
--------------------
When producer publishes a message, according to the route info, delivers the message to the specific queue.
